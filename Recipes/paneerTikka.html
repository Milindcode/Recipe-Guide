    <p><h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Paneer Tikka is a popular and delicious tandoori snack where Paneer (Indian cottage cheese cubes) are marinated in a spiced yogurt-based marinade, arranged on skewers and grilled in the oven. Worry not if you don't have an oven - instead of grilling in oven, you can make Paneer Tikka Recipe on stovetop on a tawa/skillet. In this post I am sharing both the oven and stovetop methods.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Paneer</li>
        <li>Marinade</li>
        <li>Veggies</li>
        <li>Herbs</li>
        <li>Curd</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Procedure:</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Peel, rinse and dice 1 medium-sized onion in square shaped 1 to 1.5 inches pieces. Rinse and slice 1 small to medium sized capsicum (green bell pepper) in 1 to 1.5 inches pieces. You will need ½ cup each of onions and capsicum. Set these aside. You can also use tomatoes if you want.</li>
        <li>Crush 1.5 inches ginger and 6 to 7 small to medium sized garlic to a fine paste in a mortar-pestle.</li>
        <li>Slice 200 to 250 grams block or paneer into cubes or squares and keep aside. Best is to use homemade paneer.</li>
        <li>Add ½ teaspoon black salt and regular salt as per taste. If you do not have black salt, then skip it.</li>
        <li>Slowly and gently mix them with the marinade. Cover and keep the marinated paneer and veggies in the refrigerator for 2 hours or more.</li>
        <li>Place the tray on the top rack and grill in the preheated oven for 7 to 10 minutes first at 230 to 240 degrees Celsius or 464 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>Remove once done. Serve the paneer tikka sprinkled with some chaat masala and lemon juice. Also serve mint chutney, onion slices and lemon wedges as sides.</li>
    </ol>
