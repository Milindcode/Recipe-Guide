    <p><h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>This Dal Makhani recipe is a restaurant style version with subtle smoky flavors and creaminess of the lentils. If you love authentic Punjabi food then you are going to love this Dal Makhani even more. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Udadh Dal</li>
        <li>Butter and Cream</li>
        <li>Smoked Paprika</li>
        <li>Herbs</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Procedure:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Drain Lentils well and then add them in a 3 litre pressure cooker.</li>
        <li>Pressure cook for 18 to 20 whistles on a high flame, till both the whole urad dal and rajma have cooked thoroughly and softened. If they are not cooked, then add about ½ cup water again and pressure cook for 4 to 5 whistles more. </li>
        <li>Both the rajma and urad dal are cooked and softened well. The urad dal should melt in the mouth and should not give any bite or resistance when eaten.

            You can also just mash the urad dal with a spoon or with your fingers to check the doneness. The same rule applies for kidney beans too.
            
            Keep the cooked beans aside. Both the urad dal and kidney beans have to be fresh. If they are old or close to their expiry, they take a lot of time to cook.</li>

        <li>Mix very well and sauté this mixture on a low to medium heat, till you see fat releasing from the sides. This takes about 3 to 4 minutes on a medium-low to medium heat.</li>
        <li>Then add the cooked urad dal and rajma beans.</li>

        <li>Add the remaining stock. Add 1 cup water or more if required.

            Note that you can add all of the stock or broth in which the beans were cooked. You need to get a medium consistency, so add accordingly.
            
            The quantity of stock will vary with the kind of pressure cooker used and the time taken for the beans to cook. Thus either you can choose to add all of the stock or add less stock or add water if needed to get a medium consistency in the dish.</li>
    </ol>



    <h4>Now you can enjoy the dish which is an integral part of Punjabi Cuisine</h4>
